# Implementation of Tic-Tac-Toe game using Tabular Q-learning

In this experiment,I tried implement an agent that can play Tic-Tac-Toe.In the first experiment,the agent learnt to play using Tabular Q-learning.I also conducted another experiment and my idea is that implementing two agents that should compete to win(Adversarial learning).
